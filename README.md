# Zig WebAssembly Interpreter

A tiny WebAssembly interpreter written in Zig. This interpreter implements WebAssembly 1.0 core features with selected 2.0 extensions, primarily focusing on SIMD operations.
This project is intended for personal understanding of the WebAssembly specification. Do not use in production environment.

## Requirements

- Zig 0.15.2
- Python 3.x (for test runner)
- Git (for fetching test suite)

## Build

```bash
# Build the main interpreter
zig build

# Build the spec test runner
zig build spec_test

# Or use the Makefile
make build
make build-spec-test
```

## Usage

### Running WebAssembly Files

```bash
# Run a WebAssembly binary file
./zig-out/bin/zig-wasm-interp somefile.wasm -r function_name -a 32

# Run with verbose output
./zig-out/bin/zig-wasm-interp somefile.wasm -v -r function_name -a i32:42 -a f64:3.14
```

### Running Text Format Files (.wast/.wat)

```bash
# Use the spec test runner for text format files
./zig-out/bin/spec_test test.wast -v
```

## WebAssembly Test Suite

This project uses test files from the [spectec](https://github.com/Wasm-DSL/spectec) repository (WebAssembly 3.0 branch).

**Important Note**: The test runner executes spec test assertions (`assert_return`, `assert_trap`, `assert_invalid`, etc.) against parsed and loaded modules. The 99.97% assertion pass rate reflects actual execution correctness for implemented features.

### Setup Test Suite

```bash
# Download and setup WebAssembly test files
make setup-tests

# This will:
# - Clone the spectec repository (wasm-3.0 branch)
# - Copy .wast test files to wasm_tests/
# - Exclude GC-related tests that require advanced runtime support
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all WebAssembly spec tests
make test

# Run specific test file
python3 ./run_spectec_tests.py wasm_tests/address.wast

# Run with verbose output
python3 ./run_spectec_tests.py --verbose wasm_tests/

# Stop on first failure
python3 ./run_spectec_tests.py --failfast wasm_tests/
```

## Architecture

The codebase is organized into seven main modules:

### Core Modules

1. **wasm-core** (`src/core/`): WebAssembly types, instructions, and basic structures
2. **wasm-decode** (`src/decode/`): Binary format parsing and module loading
3. **wasm-text-decode** (`src/text_decode/`): Text format (.wast/.wat) parsing
4. **wasm-validate** (`src/validate/`): WebAssembly validation rules
5. **wasm-runtime** (`src/runtime/`): Execution engine and interpreter

### Spec Test Modules

6. **spec-types** (`src/spec-types/`): Pure type definitions for spec test commands and values
   - No runtime dependencies, only depends on wasm-core
   - Defines Command, Action, Value, Result types for test specifications
   - Includes FloatType for NaN handling (canonical/arithmetic)

7. **spec-test-errors** (`src/spec-test-errors/`): Error string mapping for spec tests
   - Maps error strings from test files to typed error enums
   - Safe fallback to OtherError for unknown strings (no panics)

8. **wasm-spec-test** (`src/spec_test/`): Test execution framework
   - Unified test runner for both .wast and .json formats
   - Executor module with value conversion and comparison logic
   - JSON and WAST readers for different test formats

## Supported Features

This interpreter implements **WebAssembly 1.0 core specification**, **all WebAssembly 2.0 extensions**, and **selected WebAssembly 3.0 features**. The test suite runs **61,857/61,875 (99.97%)** spec assertions successfully across **237 test files**. Remaining failures are due to unimplemented 3.0 features (GC types, typed references).

- Memory bounds checking (traps on out-of-bounds access)

## Test Suite Status

- **237/237 test files** from [spectec](https://github.com/Wasm-DSL/spectec) successfully parse and load
- **61,857/61,875 (99.97%)** assertions pass across the test suite
- Test files cover WebAssembly 1.0, 2.0, and some 3.0 features

## Known Limitations

The following WebAssembly 3.0 features are **not implemented**:

- ❌ **Garbage Collection** (struct, array, i31ref, and related GC instructions)
- ❌ **Full Reference Type System** (non-nullable references `ref func`, typed references `ref null $t` / `ref $t`, reference subtyping)

GC features can be parsed from .wast files but their instructions are not executed.

The reference type system supports only `funcref` and `externref`. Finer-grained reference types are collapsed during parsing, which affects import matching for globals and tables that use typed references.

Additionally, the **reference type system** supports only `funcref` and `externref`. Non-nullable references (`ref func`), typed references (`ref null $t`, `ref $t`), and reference subtyping are not distinguished at the type level. This affects import matching for globals and tables that use these finer-grained reference types (21 `assert_unlinkable` failures in `linking.wast`).
